# CodeSelfPortrait
### by Sophia Ladwiniec 

### Overview
This is my self portrait drawing in p5.js. 


### Technical Details 
In this repository you will find my sketch.js file which includes all the code to my self portrait, and my initial sketch. To make this drawing I used the following functions from the p5.js library: bezierVertex, vertex, ellipse, rectangle, stroke, noStroke, and translate. I also played a lot around with the colors to make sure I found the best colors that I felt suited me and my self portait.
